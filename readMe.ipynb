        "# Unsupervised Person ReID\n",
        "\n",
        "Inspired by other worKs in unsupervised pseudo labels, we designed a two-satge system for person ReID task across different cameras. The task of matching and recognising persons across multiple camera views or datasets without the use of labelled training data is referred to as unsupervised person re-identification (ReID). Unsupervised person ReID, in contrast to supervised person ReID, which uses annotated data with identification labels for training, tries to develop effective representations exclusively from unannotated data.\n",
